# 🏗 Program Structure

The program is organized into several packages to maintain a modular code structure.

### 📂 `main`
Handles the **game loop, UI, sound system, and window setup**

### 📂 `entity`
Contains **player and NPC classes**

### 📂 `object`
Contains interactable world objects  
(keys, doors, boots, chests)

### 📂 `tile`
Handles **map loading and rendering**

### 📂 `finance`
Handles **transactions and wallet**

### 📂 `inventory`
Handles **item count and manipulation of them**

### 📂 `quest`
Handles **tasks and objectives**

### 📂 `pet`
Manages the **virtual pet system**

### 📂 `quiz`
Manages the **specific Quizmaster using ChatGPT API to grade responses** (Need API Key for API to grade responses).

This modular structure improves **code readability, maintainability, and organization**.
